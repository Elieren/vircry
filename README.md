# Vircry
## Vircry Framework
Vircry is a framework that generates backdoors.

For gluing apk with backdoor, [Evil-droid]('https://github.com/M4sc3r4n0/Evil-Droid?ysclid=l9190eapcc614065703') developments were used.

# Platforms
```
Windows
Linux
Mac os
Android
```
The program also encrypts the resulting backdoors, hiding them from antiviruses.

For the correct operation of the program, the __metasploit-framework__ is gentle!

# Start

```
$ sudo su
$ python3 start.py
```
